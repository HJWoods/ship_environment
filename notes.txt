To do:
add multiple waypoints
raycasting, configurable number of rays, detects both rocks and ships and the edge of the screen though not goal.
(maybe draw a wall around the screen so clear that it's an obstacle) done

add ships which just move backwards and forwards
ships that move towards a random waypoint(s), then stop.
Ships that chase the main ship
slight drift to rocks?
wind speed/direction, which changes over the course of the episode? Ship can detect this
add image to readme, or gif
create pip package for environment
add better sprites

vectorize? https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/speed_up_env/


        reward = 0
        # Small penalty for not moving (encourage movement)
        if v < 0.1:  # Very low velocity threshold
            reward -= 0.5  # Small penalty for not moving
        else:
            reward = -dist_goal * 0.1 # Otherwise, reward based on distance to goal
