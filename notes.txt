To do:
add multiple waypoints
raycasting, configurable number of rays, detects both rocks and ships and the edge of the screen though not goal.
(maybe draw a wall around the screen so clear that it's an obstacle)

add ships which just move backwards and forwards
ships that move towards a random waypoint(s), then stop.
Ships that chase the main ship?
slight drift to rocks?
wind speed/direction, which changes over the course of the episode? Ship can detect this
